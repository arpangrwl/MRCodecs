SecondarySort

This contains java implementation of Secondary Sort algorithm as mentioned in Data Algorithms book by M Parsian. The algorithm is implemented in Map Reduce and Spark.

Input to both programs is a text file containing data in format (year,month,day,temperature):

1948,01,01,16.4

1948,03,04,45.9

1949,02,12,46.7

1950,04,11,78.6
